        "The Bellman-Ford algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest paths from a single source vertex to all other vertices in a graph that may contain negative weights. The algorithm works as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Initialization**: Set the distance to the source vertex to 0 and all other vertices to infinity.\n",
        "2. **Relaxation**: For each vertex, update the distances to its neighboring vertices. Repeat this process for a total of \\(V-1\\) times (where \\(V\\) is the number of vertices).\n",
        "3. **Negative Cycle Detection**: After the relaxation step, perform one more iteration. If any distance can still be updated, a negative weight cycle exists in the graph.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Input Format\n",
        "You will receive a list of edges representing the graph in the format (u, v, weight), where `u` and `v` are the connected vertices, and `weight` is the edge weight. The graph may contain multiple edges between the same pair of vertices and may include negative weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Output Format\n",
        "Print the shortest path distances from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph. If a negative weight cycle is detected, indicate that a negative cycle exists.\n",

        "Consider the following graph representation:\n",
        "- **Q**: Find the shortest path distances starting from node 0.\n",
        "\n",

        "2. Perform the relaxation process for \\(V-1\\) iterations.\n",
        "3. Check for negative cycles after the relaxation steps.\n",
        "4. Print the resulting shortest path distances or indicate the presence of a negative cycle.\n",
        "\n",
