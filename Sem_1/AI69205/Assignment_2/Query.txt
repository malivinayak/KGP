The London Stock Exchange plans to launch its first marketing effort aimed
at encouraging non-British corporations to seek a listing in London, said Mr
Michael Lawrence, the exchange's new chief executive.
Mr Lawrence, who took charge in February, was outlining the changes he
intends to put in place at the stock exchange. 

The New York Stock Exchange and the US-based National
Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System share exchange
have both had extensive marketing operations for years and have been
successful in persuading leading multinational companies to seek listings in
the US.
