Sir, Liberal Democrats appear to have been robbed by look-alike Literal
Democrats of their seat in Devon and Plymouth East. Having seen the damage
that consumer confusion can inflict, they will perhaps now join the other
political parties and support the British Producers and Brand Owners Group
campaign against look-alike products.
