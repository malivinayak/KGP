Electricity consumers paid Pounds 1.23bn through the fossil-fuel levy last
year, Offer, the office of electricity regulation, said yesterday. The levy
 -which amounts to 10 per cent of electricity bills - is used to promote
sources of energy other than oil, gas and coal.
The great majority of last year's levy - 97 per cent - went to nuclear
power, with the rest going to renewable energy sources such as wind and
fuel-from-waste.
