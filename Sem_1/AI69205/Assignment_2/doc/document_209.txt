BZW, the UK-based investment bank, has been given the job of advising the
federal government taskforce which is looking into the potential
privatisation of Australia's Federal Airports Corporation, writes Nikki
Tait.
Although the possible sale has been widely flagged - BAA of the UK has been
tipped as one potential buyer - the government has yet to decide how to
proceed. There are 23 properties involved, ranging from international
airports to small domestic 'general aviation' centres.
