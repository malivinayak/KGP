Guyana's gold production in the first quarter of this year rose 20 per cent
to 86,300 troy ounces, mainly because of higher than expected production
from the country's largest miner.
Omai Gold Mines, which produced 67,670 ounces in the quarter, 4,672 above
projection, is owned by Cambior Incorporated and Golden Star Resources of
Canada and the Guyana government. It started production in January 1993 with
a target 20,000 ounces a month.
