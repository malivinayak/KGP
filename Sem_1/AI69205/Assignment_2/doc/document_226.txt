Two of Mexico's largest financial groups, Grupo Financiero Serfin and Grupo
Financiero Inverlat, plan to merge in a move that will create the country's
second-largest bank.
The merger plan, which has been approved by share-holders, will begin a
process of full integration between the two groups, which control the Serfin
and Comermex banks.
The new institution will have assets of about Dollars 36bn, placing it just
above the current second-placed bank, Bancomer.
