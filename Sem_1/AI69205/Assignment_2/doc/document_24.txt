Sir, if Mr Kit Jebens, chief executive of Lautro, the life assurance
industry regulator, believes that 'the level of abuses is now at a more
acceptable level' - as quoted in your article, 'When he dies my dear, all
this will be yours' (June 11) - then could we please be informed what is
this acceptable level. How does it compare with what Lautro thinks is an
acceptable level of abuse in other professions?
