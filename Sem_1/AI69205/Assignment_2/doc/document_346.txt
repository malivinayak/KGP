A Commons committee is expected soon to recommend that parliamentary rules
on the disclosure of MPs' dealings with the Lloyd's insurance market be made
less stringent.
The select committee on members' interests is expected to call for a rule
requiring MPs to disclose the numbers of the Lloyd's syndicates to which
they belong to be dropped.
