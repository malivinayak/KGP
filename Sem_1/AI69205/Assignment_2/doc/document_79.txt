Mr Norman Lamont, former Tory chancellor, warned yesterday that if Mr
Jean-Luc Dehaene, Belgian prime minister, became European Commission
president it would give impetus to the federalist cause.
He called on Mr John Major to maintain the government's support for Sir Leon
Brittan, who was Britain's 'excellent candidate' with a brilliant
negotiating track record.
