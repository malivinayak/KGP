Government plans to switch compensation for crime victims to fixed-tariff
payments were rejected by the Lords last night. Peers voted by 131 to 113 to
remove the provisions from the Criminal Justice and Public Order Bill.
The government immediately announced its intention to reverse the defeat
when the bill is returned to the Commons. The Home Office estimates the
defeat could result in the doubling of the cost of compensation to Pounds
500m a year by the year 2000.
