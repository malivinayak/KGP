Complaints from water customers failed to show an increase last year for the
first time since the industry's privatisation five years ago, Ofwat, the
regulator, said yesterday.
However Ofwat's annual report showed that a third of complaints continue to
be about water bills. Since privatisation, bills have risen much faster than
inflation to pay for modernisation and compliance with new environmental
rules.
