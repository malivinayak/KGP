Welcoming world soccer leaders to Chicago, the governor of Illinois, Jim
Edgar, was not so much unimpressed with the World Cup as under-awed by his
own authority.
Speaking at the opening session of the 49th congress of Fifa, soccer's
governing body, Edgar welcomed the delegates on behalf of 'the 11 1/2 people
of Illinois.'
The state has about 11.5m residents.
